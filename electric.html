            <p>Otherwise known as an EV, an electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors powered by energy stored in batteries.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Why electric over petrol/diesel?</h1>
          <p>Electricity is a renewable energy and can be remade, whilst diesel is in limited supplies. This allows electric cars to theoretically last longer periods of time, outdating diesel cars by many years. Also, electric cars are more friendly on the enviroment as diesel engines/cars cause temperature increase, and rising sea levels.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-text-blue"> What are some of the current disadvantages of using electric cars?</h1>
          <p> A majority of battery powered vehicles use lithium-ion batteries which require cobalt to make. Cobalt's leading exporter, the Democratic Republic of Congo, is notorious on many claims of child labor and unethical mining. Anothe reason includes cost, electric vehicles cost more then most diesel/petrol cars, and that may be a factor that can prevent a purchase.</p>
